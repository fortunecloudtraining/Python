# Exception -
- An exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program.
- For example:
     - Dividing a number by zero (ZeroDivisionError)
     - Trying to convert a string into an integer (ValueError)
     - Accessing a file that does not exist (FileNotFoundError)
- When these errors occur, Python stops the program unless we handle the exception.
