  -  Loop Control Statements

# Conditional Statement -
## if Statement -
- The if statement is used to test a specific condition.
- If the condition is true, a block of code (if-block) will be executed.

#### Syntax -
    if condition:
        # code to execute if condition is True

#### Example 1]:
    x = 10
    if x > 0:
        print("x is positive")

## if else Statement -
- if-else statement is used to execute a block of code when the condition in the if statement is true, and another block of code when the condition is false.
- **if statement:** Checks a condition.
  - If the condition is True, the code inside the if block is executed.
- **else statement:** Executes if the condition in the if statement is False.
  - The else block runs when the condition in the if is not met.
#### Syntax -
     if condition:
         # code to execute if the condition is True
     else:
         # code to execute if the condition is False

#### Examples-
     number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    
     if number % 2 == 0:
         print(f"{number} is even.")
     else:
