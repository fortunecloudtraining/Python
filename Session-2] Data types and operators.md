# Data Types -
- It is defined that what type of values that variable can contains.
- In python we have 8 types of datatypes as shown below:
    -  Text Type:str
    -  Numeric Types:int, float, complex
    -  Sequence Types:list, tuple, range
    -  Mapping Type:dict
    -  Set Types:set, frozenset
    -  Boolean Type:bool
    -  Binary Types:bytes, bytearray, memoryview
    -  None Type:None Type

# a) Text Type- string
- Strings (str): A sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.

# b) Numeric Type:-
- This type is also known as python numeric it contains three classes named as:
     - 1. Int
     - 2. Float
     - 3. Complex


## 1.Int:-
- it contain non-decimal values from the range 0-9

## 2.float:-
- it contains decimal values from the range 0.0-9.9

## 3.Complex:-
- in this we create a complex values in combination of int and float object it is in the form of standard complex format.
- Example:- a + ib
- It is used to solve physics problem through maths like dot, cross product, scaler and vector product calculation
- In python the format of complex value is a+b.

# Sequence Types : list, tuple, range -

# 1.List -
- A list is collection which contains heterogenous data elements that defined by sqaure bracket [] with the properties:
    - a) Ordered
    - b) Mutable
    - c) Allow Duplicates values









# c) Boolean Type -
- Data type with one of the two built-in values, True or False.
